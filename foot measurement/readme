1. Dataset Preparation
Key Features:
Collect images of feet from multiple angles and distances.
Annotate images with bounding boxes around feet using tools like LabelImg or Roboflow.
Include measurement references (e.g., a standard ruler or object) in images for accurate scaling.
Split dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.




2. Model Training
Framework: YOLOv5




Description :
             A project designed to accurately detect and measure foot dimensions using YOLOv5. This system leverages state-of-the-art object detection to identify feet in images and estimate their dimensions, enabling applications such as footwear sizing, custom shoe fitting, and medical orthotics.
