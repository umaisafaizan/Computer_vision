1. Dataset Preparation
Collect and annotate images for the specific type of violations you want to detect (e.g., traffic violations, safety helmet detection, etc.).
Use tools like LabelImg or Roboflow for annotation, ensuring labels match your violation categories.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for effective model evaluation.



2. Web Integration
Backend:
Use Django or Flask to serve the YOLOv5 model and handle incoming requests for violation detection.
Process uploaded videos or images and run inference using YOLOv5.



3. Model Training
Framework: YOLOv5




Description : 
             The Web Violation Detection Project leverages YOLOv5 to detect violations such as traffic rule breaches, workplace safety issues, or other compliance-related activities in real time. The system is designed to process video streams or images and identify predefined violations with high accuracy.
