1. Dataset Preparation
Key Features:
Collect high-quality images of hands with diverse nail shapes, sizes, and skin tones.
Annotate nail regions using segmentation tools like COCO Annotator or LabelMe.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.




2. Model Training
Framework: Mark R-CNN




Frontend:
Use web technologies like ReactJS or VueJS for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Allow users to upload hand images and choose nail colors or designs.

Backend:
Use Django or Flask to process images with the trained segmentation model.



Description : 
             The Web Nail Try-On Project utilizes Mark R-CNN for advanced nail segmentation, enabling users to virtually try on nail colors and designs in a web-based environment. This application offers a seamless and interactive platform for users to visualize how different nail styles would look on their hands.
