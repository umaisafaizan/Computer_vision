1. Dog Dataset Preparation
Key Features:
Curated dataset of dog images across various breeds, environments, and poses.
Annotation of images using tools like LabelImg or Roboflow to label dogs for training.
Dataset split into training, validation, and testing subsets.




2. Model Training
Framework: YOLOv5



3. React Native Mobile Integration
Framework: React Native




Description : 
             A cutting-edge Mobile Dog Recognition App designed for real-time detection and identification of dogs using YOLOv5 and deployed as a mobile application built with React Native. This project combines the power of deep learning and mobile technology to deliver accurate and efficient dog recognition on the go.
