1. Dataset Preparation
Key Features:
Utilizes datasets like COCO DensePose with pixel-level annotations for human body parts.
Preprocessing of images to match model requirements (resizing, normalization).
Splits dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.




2. Model Configuration
Framework: Detectron




Description :
             DensePose is a project that maps human pixels from an image to a 3D surface model of the human body. This implementation uses Detectron, a state-of-the-art modular object detection framework, to achieve accurate and efficient dense pose estimation for humans in images and videos.
