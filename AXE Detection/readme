1. Dataset Preparation
Key Features:
Custom dataset collection with images of axes in various scenarios and lighting conditions.
Dataset annotations using tools like LabelImg or Roboflow.
Splits dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.




2. Model Training
Framework: YOLOv5





Description : 
             An advanced Axe Detection System designed for real-time identification and localization of axes in images and videos. Built using YOLOv5, this project leverages state-of-the-art object detection technology to achieve high accuracy and speed in detecting axes for safety, inventory, or monitoring purposes.
